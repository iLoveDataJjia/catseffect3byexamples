ðŸ¤“ðŸ“š Learning one of the dominant Scala library for writing asynchronous codes.
The objective is to do an easy-to-access codes snippets collections of important Cats Effect 3 concepts to keep in mind.
Cats Effect 3 possesses [IO](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/3.x/cats/effect/IO.html)
for wrapping & chaining codes executions.
It has also the concept of [Resource](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/3.x/cats/effect/kernel/Resource.html)
for an automatic resources releasing after usage.
[Semaphore](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/3.x/cats/effect/std/Semaphore.html),
[CountDownLatch](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/3.x/cats/effect/std/CountDownLatch.html) and
[CyclicBarrier](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/api/3.x/cats/effect/std/CyclicBarrier.html) well known asynchronous
programming patterns are also part of the library.
